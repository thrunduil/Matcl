*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  AR_CLAHQR is an auxiliary routine called by CHSEQR to update the
*  eigenvalues and Schur decomposition already computed by CHSEQR, by
*  dealing with the Hessenberg submatrix in rows and columns ILO to IHI.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  WANTT   (input) LOGICAL
*          = .TRUE. : the full Schur form T is required;
*          = .FALSE.: only eigenvalues are required.
*
*  WANTZ   (input) LOGICAL
*          = .TRUE. : the matrix of Schur vectors Z is required;
*          = .FALSE.: Schur vectors are not required.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix H.  N >= 0.
*
*  ILO     (input) INTEGER
*  IHI     (input) INTEGER
*          It is assumed that H is already upper triangular in rows and
*          columns IHI+1:N, and that H(ILO,ILO-1) = 0 (unless ILO = 1).
*          AR_CLAHQR works primarily with the Hessenberg submatrix in rows
*          and columns ILO to IHI, but applies transformations to all of
*          H if WANTT is .TRUE..
*          1 <= ILO <= max(1,IHI); IHI <= N.
*
*  H       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDH,N)
*          On entry, the upper Hessenberg matrix H.
*          On exit, if WANTT is .TRUE., H is upper triangular in rows
*          and columns ILO:IHI, with any 2-by-2 diagonal blocks in
*          standard form. If WANTT is .FALSE., the contents of H are
*          unspecified on exit.
*
*  LDH     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array H. LDH >= max(1,N).
*
*  W       (output) COMPLEX array, dimension (N)
*          The computed eigenvalues ILO to IHI are stored in the
*          corresponding elements of W. If WANTT is .TRUE., the
*          eigenvalues are stored in the same order as on the diagonal
*          of the Schur form returned in H, with W(i) = H(i,i).
*
*  ILOZ    (input) INTEGER
*  IHIZ    (input) INTEGER
*          Specify the rows of Z to which transformations must be
*          applied if WANTZ is .TRUE..
*          1 <= ILOZ <= ILO; IHI <= IHIZ <= N.
*
*  Z       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDZ,N)
*          If WANTZ is .TRUE., on entry Z must contain the current
*          matrix Z of transformations accumulated by CHSEQR, and on
*          exit Z has been updated; transformations are applied only to
*          the submatrix Z(ILOZ:IHIZ,ILO:IHI).
*          If WANTZ is .FALSE., Z is not referenced.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z. LDZ >= max(1,N).
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          > 0: if INFO = i, AR_CLAHQR failed to compute all the
*               eigenvalues ILO to IHI in a total of 30*(IHI-ILO+1)
*               iterations; elements i+1:ihi of W contain those
*               eigenvalues which have been successfully computed.
