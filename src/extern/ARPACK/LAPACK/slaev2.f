*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  AR_SLAEV2 computes the eigendecomposition of a 2-by-2 symmetric matrix
*     [  A   B  ]
*     [  B   C  ].
*  On return, RT1 is the eigenvalue of larger absolute value, RT2 is the
*  eigenvalue of smaller absolute value, and (CS1,SN1) is the unit right
*  eigenvector for RT1, giving the decomposition
*
*     [ CS1  SN1 ] [  A   B  ] [ CS1 -SN1 ]  =  [ RT1  0  ]
*     [-SN1  CS1 ] [  B   C  ] [ SN1  CS1 ]     [  0  RT2 ].
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  A       (input) REAL
*          The (1,1) element of the 2-by-2 matrix.
*
*  B       (input) REAL
*          The (1,2) element and the conjugate of the (2,1) element of
*          the 2-by-2 matrix.
*
*  C       (input) REAL
*          The (2,2) element of the 2-by-2 matrix.
*
*  RT1     (output) REAL
*          The eigenvalue of larger absolute value.
*
*  RT2     (output) REAL
*          The eigenvalue of smaller absolute value.
*
*  CS1     (output) REAL
*  SN1     (output) REAL
*          The vector (CS1, SN1) is a unit right eigenvector for RT1.
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  RT1 is accurate to a few ulps barring over/underflow.
*
*  RT2 may be inaccurate if there is massive cancellation in the
*  determinant A*C-B*B; higher precision or correctly rounded or
*  correctly truncated arithmetic would be needed to compute RT2
*  accurately in all cases.
*
*  CS1 and SN1 are accurate to a few ulps barring over/underflow.
*
*  Overflow is possible only if RT1 is within a factor of 5 of overflow.
*  Underflow is harmless if the input data is 0 or exceeds
*     underflow_threshold / macheps.
