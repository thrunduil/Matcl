*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  AR_SLABAD takes as input the values computed by AR_SLAMCH for underflow and
*  overflow, and returns the square root of each of these values if the
*  log of LARGE is sufficiently large.  This subroutine is intended to
*  identify machines with a large exponent range, such as the Crays, and
*  redefine the underflow and overflow limits to be the square roots of
*  the values computed by AR_SLAMCH.  This subroutine is needed because
*  AR_SLAMCH does not compensate for poor arithmetic in the upper half of
*  the exponent range, as is found on a Cray.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  SMALL   (input/output) REAL
*          On entry, the underflow threshold as computed by AR_SLAMCH.
*          On exit, if LOG10(LARGE) is sufficiently large, the square
*          root of SMALL, otherwise unchanged.
*
*  LARGE   (input/output) REAL
*          On entry, the overflow threshold as computed by AR_SLAMCH.
*          On exit, if LOG10(LARGE) is sufficiently large, the square
*          root of LARGE, otherwise unchanged.
