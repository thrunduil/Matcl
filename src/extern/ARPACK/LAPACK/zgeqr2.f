*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  AR_ZGEQR2 computes a QR factorization of a complex m by n matrix A:
*  A = Q * R.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the m by n matrix A.
*          On exit, the elements on and above the diagonal of the array
*          contain the min(m,n) by n upper trapezoidal matrix R (R is
*          upper triangular if m >= n); the elements below the diagonal,
*          with the array TAU, represent the unitary matrix Q as a
*          product of elementary reflectors (see Further Details).
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*
*  TAU     (output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (min(M,N))
*          The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors (see Further
*          Details).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary reflectors
*
*     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(k), where k = min(m,n).
*
*  Each H(i) has the form
*
*     H(i) = I - tau * v * v'
*
*  where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
*  v(1:i-1) = 0 and v(i) = 1; v(i+1:m) is stored on exit in A(i+1:m,i),
*  and tau in TAU(i).
